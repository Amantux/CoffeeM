Automatic Coffee machine
MyIvana – personalized full automatic coffee machine

Technical areas	
IoT, RDIF/NFC tags, power supply, and user interface electronics


Customer’s Project Description	For many people, coffee isn’t just a hot beverage, they perceive it as a morning ritual that brings them a dose of energy and joy. In the last couple of years, we could witness an increasing awareness for quality of a coffee people drink, roasting, brewing processes and the overall experience. On the other hand, internet of things (IoT) is an emerging technology and we are starting to experience on a daily basis.  IoT is already present in many households, like temperature regulators, lighting controls, home security, etc. With a combination of IoT and full automatic coffee machine, we would combine two hot topics and the result would be a personalized coffee machine, which would brew your favorite coffee everywhere on the world, and it would allow you to monitor your daily consumption of a caffeine. One similar project has already been proposed 2 years ago and has raised almost 1 million dollars on kick starter, however it turned out to be a scam and there was no deliverable. (Check: Arist coffee machine)

A group of students will get an off-the shelf full automatic coffee machine, they will design a new control electronic, power supply and user interface electronics to drive the machine. The purpose of a new control electronics is to control the amount of coffee server per dose, the temperature of the heater, pressure on the valve, etc, in order to give user a chance to tune its own coffee brewing procedure. In addition, the personalization will be implemented via RDIF/NFC tags-reader, user interface needs to allow to save and recall a preferred brewing setting. The coffee machine will need to have an internet access to synchronize a database. Each user can have multiple unique RFID tags and each tag can be associated with a preferred coffee setting. This will be held in one big database which should be accessed from everywhere.

Deliverables	
1.	Coffee machine:
•	Power supply electronics (110V/240V) 
•	Arduino DUE based control electronics and software
•	Touch screen based user interface (Android app running on Beagle Bone Black & touch screen)
•	RFID reader attached on the coffee machine
•	Web interface and database synchronization  
•	Webpage with user interface for users. Users can check/monitor their coffee consumption.

Saeco Minuto Espresso Maker
Main reason chosen is the fact that it has a diagnostic mode, so each individual mode can be triggered seperately
